  <td>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.[1] The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.</td>

  <h3>There are six steps in the original technique:</h3>
  <ol>
   <li>Decide on the task to be done.</li><br>
    
   <li>Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally for 25 minutes).</li><br>
    
   <li>Work on the task.</li><br>
    
   <li>End work when the timer rings take a short break (traditionally 5 to 10 minutes).</li><br>
   
   <li>If you have fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three pomodoros.</li><br>
   
   <li>After three pomodoros are done, take a long break (traditionally 20 to 30 minutes). Once the long break is finished, repeat to step 2</li><br></ol>
